# Understanding VIEWS in SQL

A `VIEW` in SQL is a virtual table based on the result-set of an SQL statement. It contains rows and columns, just like a real table.

## What is a VIEW?

In SQL, a `VIEW` is a virtual table that does not physically store data, except in materialized views. Instead, it provides a way to query and access data from one or more tables through a single SQL statement. It can simplify complex queries, provide security by restricting access to certain data, and present data in a different perspective.

## Types of VIEWS

1. **Simple View**: Based on a single SQL query and does not include groups of data or join operations.
2. **Complex View**: Can include groups of data, join several tables, and use functions or subsets of data.
3. **Materialized View**: Physically stores the data returned by the query, which can improve query performance but requires additional storage space.

## How VIEWS Work

When a `VIEW` is created, SQL Server does not store the data returned by the `VIEW`. Instead, each time the `VIEW` is accessed, SQL Server reruns the SQL query in the `VIEW` definition to retrieve the data. 

## Creating a VIEW

```sql
CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

## Advantages of Using VIEWS

- **Simplification of Complex Queries**: Allows users to simplify complex SQL queries into a single `VIEW` that can be reused.
- **Security**: Provides a layer of security by allowing users to access data through the `VIEW` without giving them direct access to the underlying table permissions.
- **Logical Data Independence**: Enables changes in the database schema (like renaming a table) without altering the applications that use the data.

## Considerations When Using VIEWS

- **Performance**: Since views are regenerated every time they are accessed, performance issues can arise with complex views in large databases.
- **Update Restrictions**: Some views cannot be updated directly if they contain joins, groups by commands, or aggregate functions.
